# Advanced

Here's some stuff I've figured out how to do with the C++ API. Most of this functionality should be already exposed in tesseract.js, but if you need something which isn't possible (for instance, getting access to the raw shape data of each recognized symbol, or something similarly arcane)

These aren't formatted as executable demos, but are rather just code snippets ripped from `test.html` from `tesseract-emscripten`
